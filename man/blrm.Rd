\arguments{
\item{formula}{a R formula object that can use \code{rms} package enhancements such as the restricted interaction operator}

\item{ppo}{formula specifying the model predictors for which proportional odds is not assumed}

\item{keepsep}{a single character string containing a regular expression applied to design matrix column names, specifying which columns are not to be QR-orthonormalized, so that priors for those columns apply to the original parameters.  This is useful for treatment and treatment interaction terms.  For example \code{keepsep='treat'} will keep separate all design matrix columns containing \code{'treat'} in their names.  Some characters such as the caret used in polynomial regression terms will need to be escaped by a double backslash.}

\item{data}{a data frame; defaults to using objects from the calling environment}

\item{subset}{a logical vector or integer subscript vector specifying which subset of data whould be used}

\item{na.action}{default is \code{na.delete} to remove missings and report on them}

\item{priorsd}{vector of prior standard deviations.  If the vector is shorter than the number of model parameters, it will be repeated until the length equals the number of parametertimes.}

\item{priorsdppo}{vector of prior standard deviations for non-proportional odds parameters.  As with \code{priorsd} the last element is the only one for which the SD corresponds to the original data scale.}

\item{conc}{the Dirichlet distribution concentration parameter for the prior distribution of cell probabilities at covariate means.  The default is the reciprocal of 0.8 + 0.35 max(k, 3) where k is the number of Y categories.  The default is chosen to make the posterior mean of the intercepts more closely match the MLE.  For optimizing, the concentration parameter is always 1.0 to obtain results very close to the MLE for providing the posterior mode.}

\item{psigma}{defaults to 1 for a half-t distribution with 4 d.f., location parameter \code{rsdmean} and scale parameter \code{rsdsd}}

\item{rsdmean}{the assumed mean of the prior distribution of the standard deviation of random effects.  When \code{psigma=2} this is the mean of an exponential distribution and defaults to 1.  When \code{psigma=1} this is the mean of the half-t distribution and defaults to zero.}

\item{rsdsd}{applies only to \code{psigma=1} and is the scale parameter for the half t distribution for the SD of random effects, defaulting to 1.}

\item{ar1sdmean}{the assumed mean of the prior distribution of the standard deviation of within-subject white noise.   The setup is the same as with \code{rsdmean}.}

\item{iter}{number of posterior samples per chain for \link[rstan:sampling]{rstan::sampling} to run}

\item{chains}{number of separate chains to run}

\item{refresh}{see \link[rstan:sampling]{rstan::sampling}.  The default is 0, indicating that no progress notes are output.  If \code{refresh > 0} and \code{progress} is not \code{''}, progress output will be appended to file \code{progress}.  The default file name is \code{'stan-progress.txt'}.}

\item{progress}{see \code{refresh}.  Defaults to \code{''} if \code{refresh = 0}.  Note: If running interactively but not under RStudio, \code{rstan} will open a browser window for monitoring progress.}

\item{x}{set to \code{FALSE} to not store the design matrix in the fit.  \code{x=TRUE} is needed if running \code{blrmStats} for example.}

\item{y}{set to \code{FALSE} to not store the response variable in the fit}

\item{loo}{set to \code{FALSE} to not run \code{loo} and store its result as object \code{loo} in the returned object.  \code{loo} defaults to \code{FALSE} if the sample size is greater than 1000, as \code{loo} requires the per-observation likelihood components, which creates a matrix N times the number of posterior draws.}

\item{ppairs}{set to a file name to run \code{rstan::pairs} and store the resulting png plot there.  Set to \code{TRUE} instead to directly plot these diagnostics.  The default is not to run \code{pairs}.}

\item{method}{set to \code{'optimizing'} to run the Stan optimizer and not do posterior sampling, \code{'both'} (the default) to run both the optimizer and posterior sampling, or \code{'sampling'} to run only the posterior sampling and not compute posterior modes. Running \code{optimizing} is a way to obtain maximum likelihood estimates and allows one to quickly study the effect of changing the prior distributions.  When \code{method='optimizing'} is used the result returned is not a standard \code{blrm} object but is instead the parameter estimates, -2 log likelihood, and optionally the Hession matrix (if you specify \code{hessian=TRUE} in ...).  When \code{method='both'} is used, \code{rstan::sampling} and \code{rstan::optimizing} are both run, and parameter estimates (posterior modes) from \code{optimizing} are stored in a matrix \code{param} in the fit object, which also contains the posterior means and medians, and other results from \code{optimizing} are stored in object \code{opt} in the \code{blrm} fit object.  When random effects are present, \code{method} is automatically set to \code{'sampling'} as maximum likelihood estimates without marginalizing over the random effects do not make sense.}

\item{inito}{intial value for optimization.  The default is the \code{rstan} default \code{'random'}.  Frequently specifying \code{init=0} will benefit when the number of distinct Y categories grows or when using \code{ppo} hence 0 is the default for that.}

\item{inits}{initial value for sampling, defaults to \code{inito}}

\item{standata}{set to \code{TRUE} to return the Stan data list and not run the model}

\item{file}{a file name for a \code{saveRDS}-created file containing or to contain the saved fit object.  If \code{file} is specified and the file does not exist, it will be created right before the fit object is returned, less the large \code{rstan} object.  If the file already exists, its stored \code{md5} hash string \code{datahash} fit object component is retrieved and compared to that of the current \code{rstan} inputs.  If the data to be sent to \code{rstan}, the priors, and all sampling and optimization options and stan code are identical, the previously stored fit object is immediately returned and no new calculatons are done.}

\item{debug}{set to \code{TRUE} to output timing and progress information to /tmp/debug.txt}

\item{...}{passed to \code{rstan:optimizing}.  The \code{seed} parameter is a popular example.}
}
\value{
an \code{rms} fit object of class \code{blrm}, \code{rmsb}, \code{rms} that also contains \code{rstan} results under the name \code{rstan}.  In the \code{rstan} results, which are also used to produce diagnostics, the intercepts are shifted because of the centering of columns of the design matrix done by \code{blrm}.  With \code{method='optimizing'} a class-less list is return with these elements: \code{coefficients} (MLEs), \code{beta} (non-intercept parameters on the QR decomposition scale), \code{deviance} (-2 log likelihood), \code{return_code} (see \code{rstan::optimizing}), and, if you specified \code{hessian=TRUE} to \code{blrm}, the Hessian matrix.  To learn about the scaling of orthogonalized QR design matrix columns, look at the \code{xqrsd} object in the returned object.  This is the vector of SDs for all the columns of the transformed matrix.  Those kept out by the \code{keepsep} argument will have their original SDs.

\description{
Bayesian Binary and Ordinal Logistic Regression
}
\details{
Uses \code{rstan} with pre-compiled Stan code whose location is given by the user in \code{options(stancompiled='...')} to get posterior draws of parameters from a binary logistic or proportional odds semiparametric ordinal logistic model.  The Stan code internally using the qr decompositon on the design matrix so that highly collinear columns of the matrix do not hinder the posterior sampling.  The parameters are transformed back to the original scale before returning results to R.   Design matrix columns are centered before running Stan, so Stan diagnostic output will have the intercept terms shifted but the results of \code{blrm} for intercepts are for the original uncentered data.  The only prior distributions for regression betas are normal with mean zero, and the vector of prior standard deviations is given in \code{priorsd}.  These priors are for the qr-projected design matrix elements, except that the very last element is not changed.  So if one has a single non-interactive linear or binary variable for which a skeptical prior is designed, put that variable last in the model.

The partial proportional odds model of Peterson and Harrell (1990) is implemented, and is invoked when the user specifies a second model formula as the \code{ppo} argument.  This formula has no left-hand-side variable, and has right-side variables that are a subset of those in \code{formula} specifying for which predictors the proportional odds assumption is relaxed.

\code{blrm} also handles single-level hierarchical random effects models for the case when there are repeated measurements per subject which are reflected as random intercepts, and a different experimental model that allows for AR(1) serial correlation within subject.  For both setups, a \code{cluster} term in the model signals the existence of subject-specific random effects, and an additional model term \code{aTime(time variable)} signals the use of the AR(1) within-subject model.  The \code{time} variable must be integer valued and there can be arbitrary gaps between measurements.  However if the maximum time exceeds 200 or so one can expect much longer computation time.  When \code{aTime()} is present, the cluster-specific random effects then become the random effect for a subject's \code{time=1} record.  When \code{aTime} is specified, the covariates must not change over records within subject (no time-dependent covariates), as only the covariate vector for the earliest time for a subject is used.
