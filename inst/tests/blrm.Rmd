# Overview and Setup

`blrm` is for Bayesian binary and ordinal proportional odds logistic regression.  It is the analog of `rms::lrm` and for ordinal responses is intended for outcomes with up to a few hundred ordinal levels.  The Bayesian approach has a number of advantage over traditional frequentist models, including

1. the use of exact calculations (to within simulation error) instead of large sample (e.g., normal theory) approximations to p-values and confidence intervals
1. exact and more intuitive inference when random effects are included in the model
1. the ability to make probability statements about parameters and combinations of parameters, which includes computations or the probabilities of assertions such as "the effect of $x_1$ exceeds 1.2  **and** the effect of $x_2$ exceeds 0.7"
1. capturing more sources of uncertainty.  For example, the `blrm` function automatically computes highest posterior density intervals on a variety of statistical indexes such as the Brier score and AUROC ($c$-index).  Note: By default these intervals are computed using only 400 posterior draws to save time.  For a `blrm` fit object `f` you can specify how many samples to draw, to get more accurate intervals, by specifying for example `print(f, ns=2000)`.
1. the ability to incorporate external information or beliefs about parameters using prior distributions

`blrm` uses normal priors for the $\beta$ parameters, and the user may specify the standard deviation of these priors separately for each model parameters.  The default is $\sigma=100$ which is nearly flat.  When there are random effects, the analyst may specify the mean of the exponential distribution that serves as the prior for the standard deviation of the random effects, with the default mean being 1.0, a reasonable number for the logit scale.  There is also an option to use a half-$t$ distribution for the SD of random effects.

`blrm` uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) code written by Ben Goodrich of Columbia University.  To use `blrm` you must prepare by doing the following:

1. Install the `rstan` package
1. Run the following R commands to compile Stan code used by `rms` whenever one of the `.stan` files changes [here](https://github.com/harrelfe/stan)
```
require(rms)    # On my system: stancompiled='~/R/stan'
options(stancompiled='whatever directory to hold compiled Stan code')
stanCompile()
```
This will download and compile the `.stan` programs, and will abort if you did not install `rstan` first.  Each program takes about a minute to compile, and you **do not** need to do this step for each of your project directories.  Instead, store the compiled R objects centrally.

It is recommended that you put something like `options(stancompiled='~/R/stan')` in your home directory's `.Rprofile` file.

```{r setup}
require(rms)
knitrSet(lang='markdown', w=7, h=7, fig.path='png/')
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())   # use max # CPUs
options(stancompiled='~/R/stan', prType='html')
# Run the following once to store compiled Stan code in a central
# place for all projects
# stanCompile('~/R/stan')
```

You'll see `file='...'` in the longer running of the `blrm` calls below.  If the file already exists and none of the data nor the options sent to `rstan` nor the underlying Stan code have changed from what were used to create the fit object stored in that file (as judged by their `md5` hash), that saved fit object is returned immediately without running the `rstan` code, often saving a great deal of execution time.  This works well with the workflow of long R markdown reports making it so that only portions of Bayesian analysis that have changed are run.  Note that using the `knitr` `cache=TRUE` option does not work well as the cache files for this script were about a GB in size, and the system does not accurately recognize when a model fit hasn't changed and doesn't need to be run when `rstan` is involved.

A restored fit object does not contain the `rstan` object, saving tens of megabytes of storage.  Standard Stan diagnostics are stored in the fit object separately, and it is assumed that if the user wanted to run `rstan::loo` `loo=TRUE` would have been specified to `blrm` so that `loo` is run and its (small) result stored in the `blrm` fit object.  If you want to run `pairs` to get more graphical diagnostics, intead of relying on the `rstan` object always being available, specify `pairs=TRUE` or `pairs='filename.png'` to `blrm` to graph the pair plots.  The latter is recommended, and one can put `knitr::include_graphics('filename'png')` in the R code chunk to render the graph in the report even if `blrm` was not re-run.

When `file='filename.rds'` is specified to `blrm` and the file does not exist or analysis inputs have changed since the file was created, the `blrm` fit object will be saved in `saveRDS` `.rds` binary format in your current working directory at the completion of `blrm`'s work.  The `rstan` component is omitted from the saved file.

The utility function `fitIf` available from [here](https://github.com/harrelfe/rscripts) is another way to efficiently manage Bayesian simulation workflow.  The `fitIf` approach runs the analysis only if the file doesn't already exist.  If it exists but the data or the model have changed, the `fitIf` approach is not intelligent enough to re-run the analysis (unlike the `file='...'` approach above).  Whether using `fitIf` or `file=`,  you lose the ability to run the `rms::stanDxplot(..., rstan=TRUE)` on restored objects, so the `stanDxplot` function tries to find an existing trace plot image file corresponding to the current R markdown chunk when the fit object no longer has the `rstan` component.  For most purposes this doesn't matter, because running \code{stanDxplot} using the defaults shows the needed non-burnin samples which are always stored in fit objects.

The `blrm` AR(1) approach is experimental and is recommended only for statistical research at present; see warnings in examples below.

# Proportional Odds and Binary Logistic Regression

## Example: 10-level Ordinal Outcome

Simulate a dataset with three predictors and one 10-level ordinal outcome.  Run the frequentist proportional odds model then the Bayesian one.

```{r sim,results='asis'}
set.seed(1)
n <- 500
x1 <- runif(n, -1, 1)
x2 <- runif(n, -1, 1)
x3 <- sample(0 : 1, n, TRUE)
y <- x1 + 0.5 * x2 + x3 + rnorm(n)
y <- as.integer(cut2(y, g=10))
dd <- datadist(x1, x2, x3); options(datadist='dd')
f <- lrm(y ~ x1 + pol(x2, 2) + x3, eps=1e-7) # eps to check against rstan
f
```

Before getting posterior distributions of parameters, use `rstan` to just get maximum likelihood estimates and compare them with those from `lrm`.  Do this for increasingly flat priors for the $\beta$s.  The default prior SD for `blrm` is 100.  Running `method='optimizing'` is a quick way to study the effect of priors on the posterior modes for non-intercepts when there are no random effects in the model.  It is also a way to get a sense of the scaling of parameters used in the actual calculations (but see a later section for how to show standard deviations of variables on the transformed scale given to Stan).  Except for variables listed in the `keepsep` argument to `blrm`, prior standard deviations apply to the QR orthonormalized version of the design matrix.

```{r stanmle}
for(psd in c(0.25, 1, 10, 100, 10000)) {
	cat('\nPrior SD:', psd, '\n')
	g <- blrm(y ~ x1 + pol(x2, 2) + x3, method='optimizing', priorsd=psd)
	cat('-2 log likelihood:', g$deviance, '\n')
	print(g$coefficients)
}
# Compare with ordinary MLEs and deviance
f$deviance
coef(f)
```

Fit the model with Dirichlet priors on intercepts and wide normal priors on the $\beta$s.  Show the model fit summary.  Note that the indexes of predictive discrimination/accuracy include 0.95 highest posterior density intervals.  In frequentist inference we pretend that quantities such as AUROC and $R^2$ are estimated without error, which is far from the case.

In several places you will see an index named `Symmetry`.  This is a measure of the symmetry of a posterior distribution.  Values farther from 1.0 indicate asymmetry, which indicates that the use of standard errors and the use of a normal approximation for the posterior distribution are not justified.  The symmetry index is the ratio of the gap between the posterior mean and the 0.95 quantile of the posterior distribution to the gap between the 0.05 quantile and the mean.

```{r blrmsim,results='asis'}
bs <- blrm(y ~ x1 + pol(x2, 2) + x3, file='bs.rds')
bs
```

```{r blrmStats}
# Show more detailed analysis of model performance measures
blrmStats(bs, pl=TRUE)
```

Show basic Stan diagnostics. Had `stanDxplots(bs, rstan=TRUE)` been used, intercepts would have been shifted from what is in `g` because of subtractions of covariate means before passing data to `rstan`.

```{r standx}
stanDxplot(bs)
stanDx(bs)
```

Here are the posterior distributions, calculated using kernel density estimates from posterior draws.  Posterior models, shown as vertical lines, are parameter values that maximize the log posterior density (using `rstan::optimizing` in the original model fit) so do not necessarily coincide with the peak of the kernel density estimates.

```{r stanpost}
plot(bs)
# Also show 2-d posterior density contour for two collinear terms
plot(bs, c('x2', 'x2^2'), bivar=TRUE)   # assumes ellipse
plot(bs, c('x2', 'x2^2'), bivar=TRUE, bivarmethod='kernel')   # kernel density

# Print frequentist side-by-side with Bayesian posterior mean, median, mode

cbind(MLE=coef(f), t(bs$param))

# Compare covariance matrix of posterior draws with MLE
round(diag(vcov(f)) / diag(vcov(bs)), 2)
range(vcov(f) / vcov(bs))
```

Next show frequentist and Bayesian contrasts.  For the Bayesian contrast the point estimate is the posterior mean, and the 0.95 highest posterior density interval is computed.  Instead of a p-value, the posterior probability that the contrast is positive is computed.

```{r contrast}
contrast(f,  list(x1=0, x3=1), list(x1=.25, x3=0))
k <- contrast(bs, list(x1=0:1, x3=1), list(x1=.25, x3=0))
k
```

For Bayesian contrasts we can also plot the posterior densities for the contrasts, and 2-d highest-density contour.

```{r pcontrast}
plot(k)
plot(k, bivar=TRUE)   # applicable when exactly 2 contrasts
plot(k, bivar=TRUE, bivarmethod='kernel')
```

Compute posterior probabilities for various assertions about unknown true parameter values.  The `PostF` function is a function generator that effectively evaluates the assertion to a 0/1 value and computes the mean of these binary values over posterior draws.   As is the case with inference about the quadratic effect of `x2` below, when the assertion does not evaluate to a binary 0/1 or logical `TRUE/FALSE` value, it is taken as a quantity that is derived from one or more model parameters, and a posterior density is drawn for the derived parameter.  We use that to get a posterior distribution on the vertex of the quadratic `x2` effect.

```{r postprobs}
P <- PostF(bs, pr=TRUE)   # show new short legal R names
P(b3 > 0 & b1 > 1.5)
P(b3 > 0)
P(abs(b3) < 0.25)        # evidence for small |nonlinearity|
mean(bs$draws[, 'x2^2'] > 0, na.rm=TRUE)    # longhand calculation
# Plot posterior distribution for the vertex of the quadratic x2 effect
# This distribution should be wide because the relationship is linear
# (true value of b3 is zero)
plot(P(-b2 / (2 * b3)))
```

```{r postprobs2}
# Recreate the P function using original parameter names
# (which may not be legal R name)
P <- PostF(bs, name='orig')
P(`x2^2` > 0)
P(`x2^2` > 0 & x1 > 1.5)

# Remove rstan results from fit.  Compute  savings in object size.
# Note: this will only be accurate when running the fits for
# the first time (not when restoring shortened forms of them from
# disc)
# Result: 33.8MB before, 0.5MB after
s1 <- format(object.size(bs), 'MB')
bs$rstan <- NULL
s2 <- format(object.size(bs), 'MB')
cat('Before:', s1, '  After:', s2, '\n')
```
## Bayesian Wilcoxon Test

Since the proportional odds ordinal (PO) logistic model is a generalization of Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis tests one can use Bayesian proportional odds regression to get the Bayesian equivalent to the Wilcoxon test.  Even if not adjusting for covariates (impossible with the Wilcoxon test) there are advantages to putting this in a modeling framework as detailed in [Section 7.6](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf) of BBR.  A major advantage is estimationg ability.  One can estimate group-specific means, quantiles, and exceedance probabilities.  And Bayesian inference provides exact uncertainty intervals (highest posterior density intervals in what follows) for these.

The PO model does not require there to be any ties among the Y values, so it handles continuous data very well (the `orm` function in the `rms` package efficiently handles many thousands of distinct Y levels requiring many thousands of intercepts in the model).  Let's re-analyze the calprotectin data in Section 7.3.1 of BBR to mimic the frequentist PO analysis in Section 7.6.

```{r cpo,results='asis'}
# Fecal Calprotectin: 2500 is above detection limit
# When detection limits occur at a single value, the PO
# model easily handles this in terms of estimating group
# differences (but not for estimating the mean Y)
calpro <- c(2500, 244, 2500, 726, 86, 2500, 61, 392, 2500, 114, 1226,
            2500, 168, 910, 627, 2500, 781, 57, 483, 30, 925, 1027,
            2500, 2500, 38, 18)

# Endoscopy score: 1 = No/Mild, 2=Mod/Severe Disease
# Would have been far better to code dose as 4 ordinal levels
endo <- c(2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2,
          2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)
endo <- factor(endo, 1 : 2,
               c("No or Mild Activity", "Moderate or Severe Activity"))

dd <- datadist(endo, calpro); options(datadist='dd')
bcalpro <- blrm(calpro ~ endo, file='bcalpro.rds')
print(bcalpro, intercepts=TRUE)
# print.blrm defaults to not showing intercepts if more than 9 of them
summary(bcalpro)
```

One can see that the posterior probability of a positive group difference exceeds 0.99.

Now compute the posterior mean estimate of the mean and median calprotectin levels for the unknown data generating process, stratified by group and compare with sample estimates.

```{r bcalp}
# Sample estimates
tapply(calpro, endo, mean)
tapply(calpro, endo, median)
# Now compute estimates and 0.95 HPD intervals assuming PO
# The first method is exact
newdata <- data.frame(endo=levels(endo))
predict(bcalpro, newdata, type='mean')
# In the future type='quantile' will be added to predict
# Compute posterior mean/median estimates a different way.
# These are approximate as they compute the means and medians
# using the posterior mean parameter values and compute the
# Y mean/median on them instead of computing the Y mean/median on each
# posterior draw and then getting the means of these nonlinearly-transformed
# predicted values
bar <- Mean(bcalpro)
Predict(bcalpro, endo, fun=bar)
quant <- Quantile(bcalpro)
med <- function(lp) quant(lp=lp)
Predict(bcalpro, endo, fun=med)
```

But the `contrast` function in `rms` now allows one to get posterior distributions of differences in nonlinearly transformed parameters, as follows.

```{r bcalp2}
k <- contrast(bcalpro, list(endo=levels(endo)[1]),
                       list(endo=levels(endo)[2]), fun=bar)
k
plot(k, which='diff')
```

## Binary Regression with Restricted Cubic Splines
<a name="support"></a>

Turn to the `support` dataset and fit a binary logistic model to predict the probability of in-hospital death of critically ill adults.
`blrm` keeps posterior sampling efficient by orthonormalizing the design matrix before doing the sampling (this is done internally in the Stan code).  This allows for arbitrary collinearities, for example in the basis functions used in restricted cubic splines.  When there are such collinearities, expect to see some disagreements in estimates between `blrm` and `lrm`, because the latter does not do orthonormalization (only normalization to mean 0 variance 1).  Collinearity implies that there are many different solutions to the equations, all giving almost the same predicted values.

```{r support,results='asis',w=7,h=7}
getHdata(support)
dd <- datadist(support); options(datadist='dd')
f <- lrm(hospdead ~ dzgroup + rcs(crea, 5) + rcs(meanbp, 5),
				 data=support, eps=1e-4, x=TRUE)
f
# Compute the apparent standard error of Dxy (not accounting for overfitting)
# for comparison with the Bayesian HPD interval for Dxy
htmlVerbatim(rcorr.cens(predict(f), support$hospdead))
htmlVerbatim(Function(f))
bsup <- blrm(hospdead ~ dzgroup + rcs(crea, 5) + rcs(meanbp, 5), 
    	  		 data=support, file='bsup.rds')
bsup
htmlVerbatim(Function(bsup))   # by default uses posterior mode parameter values
# To add an intercept use e.g. Function(bsup, intercept=coef(g, 'mode')[5])

htmlVerbatim(stanDx(bsup))
stanDxplot(bsup)
plot(bsup)
```
Show approximate relative explained variation (REV) and compare this with Wald statistics from the frequentist `lrm` model.  REV is less accurate the more the multivariate posterior distribution differs from a multivariate normal distribution.  On a given posterior draw, REV for a term in the model is the Wald $\chi^2$ statistic divided by the Wald statistic for the whole model.

```{r rev,results='asis',h=2.5}
a <- anova(bsup)
a
plot(a)
anova(f)
```

**Note**: To get a Bayesian equivalent of a likelihood ratio test for comparing two models use the `rms` function `compareBmods`.

Now compute odds ratios over default inter-quartile ranges for continuous predictors, based on posterior mode parameters.  Also show 0.95 HPD intervals.  Note that unlike the `print` method, the `plot` method for `summary` doesn't actually compute HPD intervals, but approximates them by assuming normality and using the standard deviation of the posterior samples.  Compare the plot with the ordinary `lrm` result.

```{r summary, results='asis',top=2.5}
s <- summary(bsup)
s
plot(s)
plot(summary(bsup))
```

Draw partial effect plots with 0.95 HPD intervals.  Point estimates are posterior modes (which can be easily changed).

```{r peffect}
ggplot(Predict(bsup))
```

Draw a nomogram from posterior mode parameter values.

```{r nomogram}
p <- nomogram(bsup, fun=plogis, funlabel='P(death)')
plot(p)
```
For comparison here is a nomogram based on maximum likelihood estimates of parameters rather than posterior modes.

```{r nomfreq}
plot(nomogram(f, fun=plogis, funlabel='P(death)'))
```

# Partial Proportional Odds Model

The proportional odds (PO) assumption is a parallelism assumption reflecting the belief that the effect of baseline variables on, say, $Y \geq 3$ is the same effect on $Y \geq 4$.  To relax that assumption, [Peterson and Harrell](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2347760) developed the partial proportional odds (PPO) model in 1990.  The `blrm` function accepts a second model formula in the argument named `ppo` that specifies the subset of predictors for which PO is not to be assumed but for which the model is effectively polytomous (multinomial).  Note that for frequentist modeling the R `VGAM` package handles the PPO model (as will be shown below).  `VGAM` is more flexible that what `blrm` can do in allowing for all sorts of model restrictions.

Consider a $2\times 3$ table of proportions (2 treatment groups, 3 ordered outcome levels) where the treatment effect is not in PO.  We will fit a PO model and see how well it tries to reconstruct the 6 proportions, then fit a PPO model.  As of 2020-05-11 `blrm` has not implemented `predict`-type functions for PPO models, so you will se predictions done the long way (which does better show how PPO works).  Note: the `VGAM` `vgam` function parameterizes PPO effects by $y$-specific covariate effects  whereas `blrm` like Peterson and Harrell parameterize the model by estimating increments in log odds for the covariate effect for $y \geq y$ over and above the effect for $y \geq 2$ if $y$ has values 1, 2, ..., $k$.  Bayesian model specification is detailed [here](https://github.com/harrelfe/stan/blob/master/notes.md).

Not shown here is that `blrm` also allows for random effects with PPO models to handle longitudinal data if a compound symmetry correlation pattern is reasonable.

```{r ppo}
p0 <- c(.4, .2, .4)
p1 <- c(.3, .1, .6)
m  <- 50             # observations per cell
m0 <- p0 * m         # from proportions to frequencies
m1 <- p1 * m
x  <- c(rep(0, m), rep(1, m))
y0 <- c(rep(1, m0[1]), rep(2, m0[2]), rep(3, m0[3]))
y1 <- c(rep(1, m1[1]), rep(2, m1[2]), rep(3, m1[3]))

# Longitudinal Data Examples: Random Effects

## Schizophrenia Dataset from `mixor` Package

The R `mixor` package fits frequentist random effects proportional odds models.  Let's analyze the first dataset discussed in the `mixor` package vignette.  The outcome is a 4-level severity of illness scale.

```{r mixor}
require(mixor)
data(schizophrenia)
d <- schizophrenia
f <- mixor(imps79o ~ sqrt(Week) * TxDrug, id=id, link='logit', data=d)
f
sqrt(diag(vcov(f)))
```

Fit the same model using the Bayesian approach.

```{r mixorb, results='asis'}
bmixor <- blrm(imps79o ~ sqrt(Week) * TxDrug + cluster(id), data=d,
               file='bmixor.rds')
bmixor
```

The square of the posterior median for $\sigma_\gamma$ is `r median(bmixor$omega[,'sigmag'])^2` which compares well with the `mixor` estimate of 3.774.  The $\hat{\beta}$s also compare very well.  Note that the model is stated differently, which makes two of the intercepts have different meanings across packages.

## Simulated Random Effects Longitudinal Data

Let's generate some data with repeatedly measured outcome per subject where the outcome is binary and the random effects have a $N(0, 0.25^2)$ distribution.  500 subjects have 10 measurements each.

```{r re, results='asis'}
n <- 500   # subjects
set.seed(2)
re <- rnorm(n) * 0.25
X <- runif(n)   # baseline covariate, will be duplicated over repeats
m <- 10         # measurements per subject

id <- rep(1 : n, each = m)
x  <- X[id]
L <- x + re[id]   # actual logit
y <- ifelse(runif(n * m) <= plogis(L), 1, 0)
f <- lrm(y ~ x, x=TRUE, y=TRUE)     # ordinary fit
f     # now use cluster sandwich covariance estimator:
g <- robcov(f, id)  # covariance matrix adjusted for clustering
g
```

We first fit an inappropriate Bayesian model in which the random effects are omitted.

```{r bayesreo, results='asis'}
# Note: loo defaults to FALSE when n > 1000 as in this case
# Need loo for compareBmods
breo <- blrm(y ~ x, loo=TRUE, file='breo.rds')
breo
```

Now use a proper Bayesian random effects model.  The prior distribution for the standard deviation $\sigma_{\gamma}$ of the random effects ($\gamma$s) is assumed to be exponential, and we will use the default mean of this distribution of 1.0.

```{r bayesre, results='asis'}
bre <- blrm(y ~ x + cluster(id), loo=TRUE, file='bre.rds')
bre
plot(bre)
```

Before delving more into the random effects model, let's compare this new model with the previous model that erroneously omitted the random effects.

```{r compare}
compareBmods(breo, bre)
```

Roughly speaking, of the two models, the one with random effects has a probability of 0.94 of being the correct one.  See `rstan::loo` and `loo::loo.array` for details.

Now let's get into more details from the random effects model fit.

```{r bayesreh}
# Plot distribution of the 500 estimated random effects (posterior medians)
hist(bre$gammas, xlab='Estimated Random Effects', nclass=40)
```

Now generate similar data except for a bimodal random effects distribution.  This will fool the random effects normal prior into having a wider variance for a single normal distribution but will still result in estimated random effects that are somewhat realistic.

```{r re2, results='asis',w=7,h=6}
n <- 500
set.seed(3)
re <- c(rnorm(n/2, mean=-1.75), rnorm(n/2, mean=1.75)) * 0.25
cat('SD of real random effects:', round(sd(re), 4), '\n')
X <- runif(n)   # baseline covariate, will be duplicated over repeats
m <- 10         # measurements per subject

id <- rep(1 : n, each = m)
x  <- X[id]
L <- x + re[id]   # actual logit
y <- ifelse(runif(n * m) <= plogis(L), 1, 0)
breb <- blrm(y ~ x + cluster(id), file='breb.rds')
breb
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
hist(breb$gammas, xlab='Estimated Random Effects', nclass=40, main='')
hist(re,       xlab='Real Random Effects',      nclass=40, main='')
plot(re, breb$gammas, xlab='Real', ylab='Estimated')
abline(a=0, b=1)
```

## Absorbing State in Mixed Effects Ordinal Regression

`blrm` is not designed to handle this situation but let's see how it performs.

For an ordinal outcome y=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 suppose that y=5 represents an absorbing state such as death.  Suppose that subjects are observed for 10 days, and if death occurs within those days, all later values of y for that subject are set to 5.  Generate repeated outcomes under a $N(0, 0.25^2)$ random effects model with two treatments: `a` and `b`.  The `b:a` odds ratio is 0.65 and the cell probabilities are 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 corresponding to y=0-5, when the random effect is zero.

```{r os}
# Generate data as if there is no absorbing state
n <- 1000
set.seed(6)
pa <- c(.3, .3, .1, .1, .1, .1)     # P(Y=0-5 | tx=a, random effect=0)
pb <- pomodm(p=pa, odds.ratio=0.65) # P(Y=0-5 | tx=b, re=0)   # Hmisc
round(pb, 3)

re <- rnorm(n) * 0.25
tx <- c(rep('a', n/2), rep('b', n/2))   # will be duplicated over repeats
m <- 10         # measurements per subject

id   <- rep(1 : n, each = m)
time <- rep(1 : m, n)
or   <- exp(log(0.65) * (tx[id] == 'b') + re[id])
y   <- integer(n * m)
for(j in 1 : (n * m)) {
  p    <- pomodm(p=pa, odds.ratio=or[j])
	y[j] <- sample(0:5, 1, p, replace=TRUE)
}
Tx <- tx[id]
table(Tx, y)
```

The first Bayesian proportional odds model fitted is the one that exactly matches the data generation model, as we have not yet imposed an absorbing state, so that outcomes with y < 5 can appear after a y=5 outcome for the subject.

```{r noabs,results='asis'}
bst <- blrm(y ~ Tx + cluster(id), file='bst.rds')
bst
```

If `time` were to be added to the above model, you'll see that its regression coefficient is very small ($\hat{\beta}=0.009$ in this case), in alignment with the data generating model.

Now assume that state y=5 is an absorbing state.  Change observations after the first y=5 within subject to also have y=5.

```{r absorb}
require(data.table)
g <- function(x) if(length(x)) min(x, na.rm=TRUE) else 99L
u <- data.table(id, time, Tx, y, key='id')
# Add variable 'first' which is time of first y=5 for subject (99 if never)
w <- u[, .(first=g(time[y == 5])), by=id]
d <- u[w]

# Show distribution of first time of y=5
table(d[time == 1, first])
# Set all observations after the first y=5 to also have y=5
z <- d
z[time > first, y:=5]
table(u$y); table(d$y); table(z$y)
```

```{r absorb2, results='asis'}
bcf <- blrm(y ~ Tx + cluster(id), data=z, file='bcf.rds')
bcf
hist(bcf$gammas, xlab='Estimated Random Effects', nclass=40, main='')
```

The regression coefficient for treatment is too large (the true value is log(0.65) = `r round(log(0.64), 3)`).  The standard deviation of random effects is large (the true value is 0.25), reflecting increased dependence of outcomes without subject due to the duplication of y=5 records.  **However** the data being analyzed were not formally generated with the model that has a treatment odds ratio of 0.65.  Repeated correlated ordinal outcomes were generated with that odds ratio and with a random effect standard deviation of 0.25, but then the outcomes were overridden in the following fashion: The first time within a subject that y=5 causes suppression of all later records.

The histogram of estimated subject random effects (posterior medians) shows some bimodality with heavy right tail due to the y=5 absorbing state.  Let
s also plot the random effects against the time of death (99 if the subject did not die, recoded here to 15).

```{r revst}
t5 <- subset(z, time == 1)$first
t5 <- ifelse(t5 == 99, 15, t5)
plot(t5, bcf$gammas, xlab='Time of y=5', ylab='Random Effect')
```
What happens with time is added to this model?

```{r absorb3, results='asis'}
bcft <- blrm(y ~ Tx + time + cluster(id), data=z, file='bcft.rds')
bcft
```

We see that the slope of time is very large, but the treatment effect and random effect standard deviation are still very large.

Look at random effects again.

```{r bcftre}
hist(bcft$gammas, xlab='Estimated Random Effects', nclass=40, main='')
plot(t5, bcft$gammas, xlab='Time of y=5', ylab='Random Effect')
```

Next we truncate patient records so that y=5 is not carried forward.

```{r nocarry,results='asis'}
zt <- z[time <= first]
bnc <- blrm(y ~ Tx + cluster(id), data=zt, file='bnc.rds')
bnc
```

Finally, add time to the above model.

```{r nocarryt, results='asis'}
bnct <- blrm(y ~ Tx + time + cluster(id), data=zt, file='bnct.rds')
bnct
```

The time effect is very weak, and adding it did not change the already-accurate (with respect to the first part of the data generating mechanism) treatment effect posterior mean.

## AR(1) Correlation Structure

Thanks to Stan code written by Ben Goodrich, `blrm` also implements a correlation struction that is more realistic for most problems.  Subject (cluster) random effects pertain to the first measurement for the subject, then subsequent measurements are correlated within cluster according to an `aTime` variable specified in the model.  The actual time values are not used in the analysis but the distinct values are converted to consecutive integers.  The within-cluster process is AR(1) for the random effects, and a separate within-cluster white noise variance $\sigma_w$ is incorporated.  This implies that the correlation of two measurements within a subject is higher when the measurements are closer together in time, the the correlation decaying exponentially as the time gap widens within cluster.

## Simulated Data 1

Before simulating data that has exactly the structure described above, let's simulate repeated ordinal responses where the repeats are exact duplicates.  This is done to determine whether the random effects/AR(1) model can recover a large value of $\rho$ (here 1.0).

```{r ar1dup, results='asis'}
n      <- 500    # subjects
sigmag <- 1      # SD of random intercepts

set.seed(7)
re <- rnorm(n) * sigmag   # overall increment in logit per subject
X  <- runif(n)   # baseline covariate, will be duplicated over repeats
m  <- 5          # measurements per subject
id <- rep(1 : n, each = m)
# Generate the first ordinal response per subject (time 1)
Y  <- round(pmax(-2, pmin(3, 2 * X + re)))
time <- rep(1 : m, n)
x <- X[id]
y <- Y[id]
bdup <- blrm(y ~ x + cluster(id) + aTime(time), refresh=50, file='bdup.rds')
bdup
```

The posterior mean $\rho$ is 0.70 whereas the true value is 1.0.  The regression coefficients do not appear to be reasonable.

```{r bdupdx}
stanDx(bdup)
stanDxplot(bdup)
```

## Simulated Data 2

Let's simulate a dataset that has exactly this structure and see if the Bayesian model can recover that structure.

```{r simar1}
n      <- 1000    # subjects
sigmag <- 1      # SD of random intercepts
rho    <- .7     # autocorrelation of random effects
# To force constant variance of random effects over time (as the Stan
# model assumes)
sigmaw <- sigmag * sqrt(1 - rho*rho)
sigmaw
set.seed(20)
re <- rnorm(n) * sigmag   # for time=1 for each subject
X  <- runif(n)   # baseline covariate, will be duplicated over repeats
m  <- 10         # measurements per subject
id <- rep(1 : n, each = m)
time <- rep(1 : m, n)
re1  <- matrix(NA, nrow=n, ncol=m)
re1[, 1] <- re
for(j in 2 : m)
  re1[, j] <- rho * re1[, j-1] + rnorm(n) * sigmaw
# Check constancy of random effect variance over time
round(diag(var(re1)), 2)
round(cor(re1), 2)    # looks good
re1[13, ]             # check 13th subject
# Check within and between-subject correlations with no covariates
L <- re1[cbind(id, time)]
L[id == 13]
# xless(cbind(id, time, plogis(L)))
# Reconstruct with time going across to make sure everything is working
LL <- matrix(NA, nrow=n, ncol=m)
LL[cbind(id, time)] <- L
identical(LL, re1)

y <- ifelse(runif(n * m) <= plogis(L), 1, 0)
# For a subset of pairs of different subjects compute between-subject
# correlation measure for binary variables
rp <- function(x, y) mean(x * y) - mean(x) * mean(y)
r <- numeric(100^2)
k <- 0
for(i in 1 : 100) for(j in 101 : 200) {
  k <- k + 1
  r[k] <- rp(y[id == i], y[id == j])
}
hist(r, nclass=80)

# For each pair of times compute within-subject correlation measure
# and show this as a function of time gap
nc <- n * m * (m - 1) / 2
gap <- y1 <- y2 <- integer(nc)
k <- 0
for(i in 1 : (m-1)) for(j in (i+1):m) for(s in 1 : n) {
  k <- k + 1
  gap[k] <- abs(i - j)
  y1[k] <- y[id == s & time == i]
  y2[k] <- y[id == s & time == j]
}
u <- tapply(1 : k, gap, function(i) rp(y1[i], y2[i]))
u

# Now include the covariate (true beta = 1)
L  <- X[id] + re1[cbind(id, time)]
y  <- ifelse(runif(n * m) <= plogis(L), 1, 0)
x  <- X[id]
```
Ordinary logistic model ignoring the correlation pattern (`lrm(y ~ x)`) yields $\hat{\beta} = 0.87$, SE=0.07 (0.09 with cluster sandwich correction).

Fit a Bayesian model that has random effects but ignores the additional within-subject serial correlation given the random effect.

```{r fitwrong,results='asis'}
bnoar1 <- blrm(y ~ x + cluster(id), file='bnoar1.rds')
bnoar1
```

We see that the SD of the random effects, $\sigma_\gamma$ was underestimated.  The $\hat{\beta}$ posterior mean and median look good, as well as the standard deviation of the posterior distribution.

Before running the AR(1) model let's look at the correlation matrix of `y` as `rstan` sees it (as a matrix with rows = subjects and columns = times).

```{r looky}
d <- blrm(y ~ x + cluster(id) + aTime(time), standata=TRUE)
round(cor(d$y), 2)
```

The within-subject correlation pattern in the raw binary responses are damped in comparison with the correlation pattern of the underlying random effects.  Help needed here.

Now fit the combination random intercept/AR(1) Bayesian binary logistic model.

```{r fitar1}
bar1 <- blrm(y ~ x + cluster(id) + aTime(time), file='bar1.rds')
```

First look at diagnostics.

```{r bar1dx}
stanDx(bar1)
stanDxplot(bar1, which=c('x', 'sigmag', 'rho'))
# To check rho draws with rstan if the rstan object is saved in bar1:
# (use stanDxplot(bar1, which='rho', rstan=TRUE) to get line plots)
if(length(bar1$rstan)) {
  z <- rstan::extract(bar1$rstan, permuted=FALSE)
  for(chain in 1 : 4) {
    rhos <- z[, chain, 'rho']
    plot(1 : length(rhos), rhos, col=gray(0.4), cex=.1, xlab='', ylab='')
  }
}
```

And now the fit summary.

```{r bar1summary,results='asis'}
bar1
```

The posterior mean $\beta$ and standard deviation of the posterior for $\beta$ look good.  The posterior median of $\sigma_\gamma$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ that used in simulating the data, and $\rho$ is $\frac{1}{7}$th.

## Example Real Data AR(1) Analysis

The R [LMest package](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v081i04/v81i04.pdf) comes with a dataset from the [Health and Retirement Study](http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu) conducted at the University of Michigan.  The outcome is self-report health status on an ordinal 5-point scale.  Participants were interviewed approximately every two years for eight years.  The dataset is also analyzed in a [vignette for the R mvord package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvord/vignettes/vignette_mvord2.html#example-4---a-longitudinal-model).  The dataset was retrieved from [here](https://github.com/cran/LMest/tree/master/data).  It has 56592 rows for 7074 individuals.

```{r srhsdata, results='asis'}
load('data_SRHS_long.rda')
d <- data_SRHS_long
d <- upData(d, rename=c(gender='sex'),
               sex  = factor(sex, 1:2, c('male', 'female')),
               race = factor(race, 1:3, c('white', 'black', 'other')),
               education = factor(education, 1:5, c('high school', 'GED',
                 'high school graduate', 'some college',
                 'college and above')), print=FALSE)
dd <- datadist(d); options(datadist='dd')
html(describe(d))
```

Start with an approximate GEE-type proportional odds model.

```{r srhsgee,results='asis'}
f <- lrm(srhs ~ t + sex + race + education + age, data=d, x=TRUE, y=TRUE)
g <- robcov(f, d$id)
g
```

Now fit the Bayesian random effects AR(1) model on the first 1000 subjects.  Current implementation of `blrm` does not allow for varying covariates so we had to exclude the linear time trend effect on the overall log odds.  We do use time to specify the AR(1) correlation structure.  Runtime was 15m using four cores.

```{r srhsb,results='asis'}
d <- subset(d, id <= 1000)
srhs <- blrm(srhs ~ aTime(t) + cluster(id) +
             sex + race + education + age, data=d,
             loo=TRUE, refresh=50, file='srhs.rds')
srhs
```

We see that this Bayesian model was unable to recover the high value of $\rho$ of 0.76 found in Example 5 from [this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvord/vignettes/vignette_mvord2.html#example-5---self-reported-health-status) (although that analysis included a linear time trend).

```{r srhsbdx}
srhs$loo
stanDx(srhs)
stanDxplot(srhs)
```

# Multiple Imputation

When possible, full joint Bayesian modeling of (possibly missing) covariates and the outcome variable should be used to get exact inference in the presence of missing covariate values.  Another good approach is to use multiple imputation with stacking of posterior draws after running the Bayesian model for each completed dataset.  When doing posterior inference on the stacked posterior draws the uncertainty from multiple imputation is fully taken into account, and so is the change in posterior distribution.   Frequentist inference requires complex adjustments, as multiple imputation alters the sampling distribution of model parameter estimates.  For example, regression coefficient estimates that have a normal distribution with complete data may have a $t$-like distribution after multiple imputation.

`blrm` works with the `stackMI` function in the `rms` package to make posterior stacking easier.  It works with `Hmisc::aregImpute` and the `mice` package.  `stackMI` is the analog of the `Hmisc::fit.mult.impute` but is much simpler due to the use of the Bayesian paradigm.

Here is an example adapted from the `aregImpute` help file.

```{r aregi,w=7,h=7}
set.seed(2)
n <- 1000
x1 <- factor(sample(c('a','b','c'), n, TRUE))
x2 <- (x1=='b') + 3*(x1=='c') + rnorm(n,0,2)
x3 <- rnorm(n)
xbeta <- 0.35 * (x2 + 1 * (x1 == 'c') + 0.2 * x3)
y  <- ifelse(runif(n) <= plogis(xbeta), 1, 0)
x1[1:250]   <- NA
x2[251:350] <- NA
d <- data.frame(x1,x2,x3,y, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)

mi <- aregImpute(~ y + x1 + x2 + x3, nk=3, data=d, B=10, n.impute=5, pr=FALSE)
mi

# Note: The following model will be re-run every time aregImpute runs
# because imputations have randomness
bmi <- stackMI(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, blrm, mi, data=d, refresh=50, file='bmi.rds')
stanDx(bmi)
stanDxplot(bmi, which='x1=c', rev=TRUE, stripsize=5)
```

```{r aregip,w=7,h=6}
plot(bmi)
```

One can see that the 5 individual posterior distributions for the frequently missing variables `x1` and `x2` vary a lot, but not so for the never missing variable `x3`.

Computations done on the `bmi` object will automatically use the full stacked posterior distribution.
  
# Scaling and Intepretation of Priors on $\beta$s

`blrm` orthonormalizes the data design matrix to greatly improve posterior distribution sampling in the case of collinearities among predictors (especially among spline basis functions).  Through the `keepsep` argument one can hold out selected columns of the design matrix from QR orthogonalization so that prior standard deviations will apply to known quantities.  When no columns are held out in this way, one can get a sense of the new QR scale on the translated columns by printing the standard deviations of the QR-transformed design matrix columns, which is stored in the `xqrsd` object in the fit object.  The following example compares this to the SDs from the original design matrix (which is stored in the `x` object in the fit).

```{r qrscale}
set.seed(1)
n  <- 200
x  <- runif(n, 0, 10)
tx <- rep(0:1, n/2)
y  <- sample(0:1, n, TRUE)
f  <- blrm(y ~ tx + pol(x, 3), iter=500)
rbind(apply(f$x, 2, sd), f$xqrsd)
```

The `selectedQr` function can be used to recompute the transformed data matrix for further examination.  You'll see that when centering is used (as with `blrm`) the transformed columns are orthogonal.

# Speed of `blrm` For Large Numbers of Y Levels

When there is a large number of intercepts in the model, the speed of `blrm` will decrease.  What about the speed of using `blrm` just to get (potentially penalized) maximum likelihood estimates?  Let's try fitting a progressively more continuous dependent variable.  
```{r manyint}
set.seed(1)
n <- 1000
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- x + rnorm(n)
for(g in c(2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256)) {
  cat('\n', g, 'distinct values of y\n')
  yg <- cut2(y, g=g)
  print(system.time(f <- blrm(yg ~ x, method='optimizing')))
}

```
This is impressive.  For g=256 compare with the execution time of the Newton-Raphson method making optimum use of sparse matrices.  Also compare coefficients.  When sampling is done, the default Dirichlet distribution concentration parameter for the intercepts is selected to make the posterior means agree with maximum likelihood estimates, sacrificing some performance of posterior modes.  When `method='optimizing'`, instead a concentration parameter of 1.0 for the Dirichlet prior distribution for intercepts is always used, which seems to make optimization agree more with maximum likelihood estimates.  This optimization is used to get posterior modes when random effects are not present.

```{r morm}
system.time(g <- orm(yg ~ x))
plot(coef(g), coef(f), xlab='Coefficients from orm',
     ylab='Coefficients from blrm')
abline(a=0, b=1, col=gray(0.8))
```


See how long it takes to do posterior sampling with `rstan` when there are 16, 64, or 128 levels of y.

```{r sampmany}
for(g in c(16, 64, 128)) {
  cat('\n', g, 'distinct values of y\n')
  yg <- cut2(y, g=g)
  print(system.time(h <- blrm(yg ~ x)))
}
```
